               <h1>Myhub Privacy Policy</h1>

				<p>This Privacy Policy was updated on January 8th at 12am MST.</p>

				<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to the Myhub website (the “Site”) and services (together with the site, the “Application”) and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>

				<p>By using the Services, you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content and information about events, including your username, photos, comments and other materials (“User Content”), and to share User Content with other users. This means that other users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content or other information that you make publicly available, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>

				<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who use the Services (“Users”). This Privacy Policy does not cover any information collected through any other application, website or services. Please note that the Services may contain links to other services not controlled or created by Myhub. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites, and we recommend that you review the privacy policies of each web site that you visit.</p>
				
				<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

                <p>We collect the following types of information.</p>

                <h3>Information you provide us directly:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for a Myhub account.</li>

                    <li>Profile information that you provide for your user profile.</li>

                    <li>User Content that you post to your profile or account (for example, events, photos, comments, etc.).</li>

                    <li>Payment information necessary to make or receive payments through the Services, including credit card numbers, expiration dates and security codes; information regarding digital payment accounts (e.g. PayPal); and/or bank account information such as account and routing numbers.</li>

                    <li>Communications between you and Myhub. For example, we may send you emails related to account verification, changes or updates to features of the Services, technical and security notices, and the like. These communications are necessary and, therefore, Users may not opt out of certain emails.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Finding your friends on Myhub:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you choose, you can use our "Find Friends" feature to locate other people with Myhub accounts either through your device’s contacts list or third-party social media sites.</li>

                    <li>If you choose to find your friends through your device's contacts list, then Myhub will access your contacts list to determine whether or not Users exist that are associated with your contacts.</li>

                    <li>If you choose to find your friends through a third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</li>

                    <li>Note about "Invite Friends" feature: If you choose to invite someone to become a User through our "Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that (a) you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and (b) because this invitation is coming directly from your personal account Myhub does not have access to or control this communication.</li>

                    <li>We may track information about use of our “Find Friends” and “Invite Friends” features through referral links.
</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Analytics information:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>We use third-party analytics tools to measure traffic and usage trends in connection with the Services. These tools collect information sent by your device or otherwise in connection with the Services, including usage statistics and other information that assists us in improving the Services. We collect and use this analytics information aggregated with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Log file information:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</li>

                    <li>When you use the Services, our servers may automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser or device type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Device identifiers:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access the Services, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by or through the Services.</li>

                    <li>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

                <p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information described in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Create and populate your User profile and post your comments;</li>

                    <li>Help you efficiently access your information after you sign in to the Services;</li>

                    <li>Remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the Services;</li>
                    <li>Make, receive or transmit payments through the Services, e.g. in connection with paid events;</li>

                    <li>Provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing;</li>

                    <li>Provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of the Services;</li>

                    <li>Develop and test new products and features;</li>

                    <li>Monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns;</li>

                    <li>Diagnose or fix technology problems;</li>

                    <li>Automatically update the Services on your device(s).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

                <p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Myhub (or the group of companies of which Myhub is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Privacy Policy.</p>


                <h3>Parties with whom we may share your information:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Myhub is part of, or that become part of that group ("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Services (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). These Affiliates are required to honor the choices you make about who can see your User Content.</li>

                    <li>In the event you elect to make or receive payments through the Services, we may share your payment information and other information necessary for such payments with our third-party payment processing service.  For more information on third-party payment processing, see our Terms of Use.</li>

                    <li>We also may share your User Content and information with third-party organizations that help us provide the Services to you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide their services under reasonable confidentiality terms.</li>

                    <li>We may also share certain information with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</li>

                    <li>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</li>

                    <li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Services, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy settings in connection with the Services, please change your profile setting. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.
</li>

                    <li>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other Users.</li>

                    <li>If you remove information that you posted to the Services, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Application or Website, or if other Users or third parties using the Services have copied or saved that information.</li>


                </ul>

                <h3>What happens in the event of a change of control:</h3>

                <p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Myhub or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through the Services may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will be required to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h3>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</h3>

                <p>
	                We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.

                </p>


                <h2>HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

                <h3>Storage and Processing:</h3>

                    <li>Myhub, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</li>

                    <li>By registering for and using the Services, you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any other country in which Myhub, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>

                    <li>In connection with the making, receiving or transmission of payments, we may provide your payment information to third-party payment processing services, which are responsible for storing and maintaining the security of such information pursuant to their own privacy policies and/or merchant services agreements.  Myhub is not responsible or liable for compliance with these policies or agreements.   For more information about payment processing services, see our Terms of Use.</li>

                    <li>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Myhub, at all times.
